**Function of DNS:**

The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like the internet's phonebook. Its primary function is to translate human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into numerical Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like 172.217.160.142) that computers use to identify each other on a network. Without DNS, you would need to remember the specific IP address for every website or service you want to access.

**Configuring DNS settings on a firewall is crucial for several reasons:**

Preventing Access to Malicious Sites: DNS Security profiles can block queries to known malicious domains associated with malware, phishing, or command-and-control (C2) servers.

Enabling Network Access: Firewalls often act as DNS relays or proxies for internal clients. Proper DNS configuration ensures that users behind the firewall can resolve external domain names to access websites and internet services.


**Function of NAT:**

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a fundamental technique used by firewalls and routers. Its primary function is to modify the IP address information within the headers of network packets as they traverse the device. The most common types are:

Source NAT (SNAT): This changes the source IP address of packets, typically translating private internal IP addresses (like 192.168.1.20 used by Client-A in the lab topology) into a public IP address (often the firewall's external interface IP). This allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet, conserving public IP addresses and hiding the internal network structure. 

Destination NAT (DNAT): This changes the destination IP address of incoming packets. It's often used to allow external users to access services hosted on servers within the private network (like potentially the DMZ server shown in the topology). This is also known as port forwarding. Â

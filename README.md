**Configuring Initial Firewall Settings**
---

**Function of DNS:**

The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like the internet's phonebook. Its primary function is to translate human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into numerical Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like 172.217.160.142) that computers use to identify each other on a network. Without DNS, you would need to remember the specific IP address for every website or service you want to access.

**Configuring DNS settings on a firewall is crucial for several reasons:**

Preventing Access to Malicious Sites: DNS Security profiles can block queries to known malicious domains associated with malware, phishing, or command-and-control (C2) servers.

Enabling Network Access: Firewalls often act as DNS relays or proxies for internal clients. Proper DNS configuration ensures that users behind the firewall can resolve external domain names to access websites and internet services.

**Function of NAT:**

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a fundamental technique used by firewalls and routers. Its primary function is to modify the IP address information within the headers of network packets as they traverse the device. Â  

**Why it's important: NAT is crucial for firewalls primarily for:**

IPv4 Address Conservation: It allows multiple devices on a private network (using non-routable private IPs like 192.168.x.x) to share a single or a small pool of public IP addresses for internet access. This significantly alleviates the shortage of public IPv4 addresses.

Security through Obfuscation: By hiding internal private IP addresses from the external network, NAT prevents external entities from directly mapping or accessing internal devices, thus reducing the attack surface. Traffic must pass through the firewall where security policies can be applied.

Network Flexibility: It simplifies internal network addressing and allows for easier network changes without needing to re-address numerous devices if the public IP changes.

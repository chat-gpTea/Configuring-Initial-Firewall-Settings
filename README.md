**Function of DNS:**

The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like the internet's phonebook. Its primary function is to translate human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into numerical Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like 172.217.160.142) that computers use to identify each other on a network. Without DNS, you would need to remember the specific IP address for every website or service you want to access.

**Configuring DNS settings on a firewall is crucial for several reasons:**

Preventing Access to Malicious Sites: DNS Security profiles can block queries to known malicious domains associated with malware, phishing, or command-and-control (C2) servers.

Enabling Network Access: Firewalls often act as DNS relays or proxies for internal clients. Proper DNS configuration ensures that users behind the firewall can resolve external domain names to access websites and internet services.

**Function of NAT:**

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process used by routers and firewalls to modify the IP address information in the headers of network packets as they pass through. Its most common use case is Source NAT (SNAT), which allows multiple devices on a private network (using private IP addresses like those in the 192.168.x.x range) to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet.
